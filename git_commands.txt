FILE CHANGE DIFFERENCES
____________________________
git diff
        - diff between working copy and stage

git diff filename

git diff --staged filename
git diff --staged 
	- displays the difference between repository last commit and stagged changes

git rm filename
	- removes the file and applies the changes to stage area

git rm --cache filename.txt
        - in case if file is stagged want to unrecognize or made it as untracked but it wont remove the file physically but removed from repository

CHECK THE HISTORY OF COMMITS

	-gives commit history in given format commit hash, user, hours, comment for commit

UNDOING THINGS
____________________
git commit --amend
	-changes the hash commit id but same version of the code, IMP this is possible only when there are no latest commits
git restore --staged filename
	- in case if we accidently made file as untraced then revert by using the restore command.
        - this also does in case if the file is stagged and want to unstage

git restore --staged filename
git reset HEAD filenam
	- removes the files from stage area but not actual file changes

Below commands both does same operations[works only unstagged stage]
git restore filename.txt
git checkout -- filename
	- reverts the modified file changes
	-[DANGEROUS COMMAND] 


GIT REMOTE REPOSITORIES
